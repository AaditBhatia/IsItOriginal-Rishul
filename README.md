# IsItOriginal-Rishul
My friend Rishul Bhardwaj often quotes Carryminati, his favorite youtuber, and claims that its his own words. I am making an application which would help me to detect when he has quoted the youtuber.
I will be making a python application, which would parse all carryminati videos, and generate a text file. The problem encountered is that not all videos have transcripts associated with them.
To solve this, I will convert audio to text for the videos which do not have transcripts. The issue that will be encountered here is that the accuracy will not be very high. I will try to use a spell checker and verify the word, using what I have learnt in my computer science 446, search engines class.
After generating text files, I will integrate all this into an android application. 
I will construct an index, 
Then the android application will listen to what Rishul says, and try to find each word from the index, and find matching windows.
